# YouTube_Clone_Assignment
# YouTube Home Page Clone

In Week 5, you have learned how to build web pages using the Sinatra framework, HTML and CSS.

Your weekend challenge is simple; clone the YouTube Home Page using Sinatra framework, HTML and CSS. Do your best to make your clone as close as possible to the actual YouTube homepage.

# Additional requirements:
- You must use external CSS file when styling your page and reference the CSS properly using the <link> tag in your erb files.
- You must write your own CSS rules, using a CSS framework such as Bootstrap would not be accepted as completing the challenge.
- You will only need to style the page such that it looks decent on a desktop screen size. No need to account for mobile phone screen.
- You may use any appropriate image to represent the YouTube video thumbnails.

# Tips:
- Use Web Inspector feature on your browser (Chrome/Firefox) to help you debug your CSS or get inspiration on how to write your CSS.
- You may use HTML elements or CSS properties not covered in class, but to maximise learning, please study the HTML element and CSS property that you are trying to use before putting it into your HTML/CSS file. Do NOT simply copy and paste without knowing what you are doing.
- Make use of the wealth of Internet resources to achieve the required styling based on the YouTube home page.
- As always, if you are stuck even after consulting Internet resources, you may contact me (Coach Faezrah) through Telegram for assistance.
